# Unity 2D Fluid Simulation

This project is a 2D fluid simulation implemented in Unity. It uses particle-based methods to simulate fluid dynamics, including gravity, collision detection, and spatial hashing for efficient neighbor searching.

## Project Structure

- **Assets/personalAssests/ParticleSimulation.cs**: Main script for the particle simulation. It initializes particles, applies fluid dynamics, gravity, and collision detection, and draws the particles.
- **Assets/personalAssests/Collision.cs**: Handles collision detection and resolution for particles.
- **Assets/personalAssests/FluidDynamics.cs**: Contains functions to calculate pressure, density, and apply fluid dynamics to particles.
- **Assets/personalAssests/GravityScript.cs**: Applies gravity to particles.
- **Assets/personalAssests/ParticleArrayScript.cs**: Initializes particle arrays and defines the `Particle` class.
- **Assets/personalAssests/SimulationControls.cs**: Handles user input for controlling the simulation, such as pushing and pulling particles and adjusting the radius.
- **Assets/personalAssests/SpatialHashingScript.cs**: Implements spatial hashing for efficient neighbor searching in the particle simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to a local folder:
2. In Unity Hub "Add" that local folder to your projects
3. open project and enjoy





### Usage
Attach the ParticleSimulation script to a GameObject in your scene.
Configure the public variables in the ParticleSimulation script as needed:
particleCount: Number of particles in the simulation.
particleRadius: Radius of each particle.
particleInfluenceRadius: Influence radius for fluid dynamics calculations.
colorParVelDen: Toggle to color particles based on velocity or density.
hash: Toggle to use spatial hashing for neighbor searching.
Attach the other scripts (Collision, FluidDynamics, GravityScript, ParticleArrayScript, SimulationControls, SpatialHashingScript) to appropriate GameObjects or the same GameObject as ParticleSimulation.
Run the scene to see the fluid simulation in action.
Controls (WIP)
Left-click: Push particles at the mouse position. //only displays cordinates in consel
Right-click: Pull particles to the mouse position. //only displays cordinates in consel
Mouse Scroll Wheel: Adjust the radius value. //only displays controller radius in consel
